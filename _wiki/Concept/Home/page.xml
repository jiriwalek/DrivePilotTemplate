1 Concept
Use this space to define and document high-level concepts for your project. 

A business case is made for the project. Technical, economic, and political feasibility is assessed; benefits and costs are estimated; and key risks are identified. Alternative concepts for meeting the project’s purpose and need are explored. 

Two default Documents are provided in the Concept space that can be filled in to define the project scope and capture results of a feasibility study.

The feasibility study provides a basis for understanding and agreement among project decision makers – project management, executive management, and any external agencies that must support the project, such as a regional planning commission.
